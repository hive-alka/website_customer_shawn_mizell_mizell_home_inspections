        review: 'My home inspector Eric was absolutely Fantastic. He was thorough, professional, and took the time to explain everything clearly. I stayed in my car during the inspection, and he came out a few times to give me updates and walk me through what he was seeing. It made the whole process so much easier and less stressful. Highly recommend!',

        review: 'Shawn was absolutely amazing! My husband and I purchased a new home out of state and having Shawn as our inspector put our minds at ease. He was beyond thorough, he explained a lot to us and he made us even that much more confident in our home and the integrity of it! You can always tell when something is just a job to someone and when someone does what they do to truly help people, Shawn does this to truly help people! I cannot recommend Mizell Home Inspections enough!',

        review: 'We hired Mizell Home Inspections for a 4 Point Inspection and were very pleased with the service. Dan Crist did the Inspection and arrived in a timely manner to our appointment, was very professional in explaining what the service would entail and went about conducting the inspection. He went into each area to inspect the plumbing and on to the roof for that inspection. At the end we went over some of the details and he informed me to expect a Report in the evening or next day and it was in my email box. I highly recommend to use Mizell for any Inspection need...both Residential and Commercial',
