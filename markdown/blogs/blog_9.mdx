### What to Ask Your Inspector

Before hiring, ask:
- How long have you been inspecting?

- Can I attend the inspection?
- When will I receive the report?
- What format is the report?
- Do you offer any guarantees?
- Are you insured?

### Attending the Inspection

### Common First-Time Buyer Questions

**Q: Will the inspector tell me if I should buy the house?**
A: No, inspectors provide information but don't make buy/don't buy recommendations. That decision is yours.

**Q: What if major problems are found?**
A: You can request repairs, ask for price reduction, or walk away if you have an inspection contingency.

**Q: Should I be there the whole time?**
A: At minimum, attend the beginning and end. The final walkthrough is most important.

**Q: Can I bring my contractor?**
A: Usually yes, but check with your inspector first. Keep the group small.

**Q: What if the seller refuses repairs?**
A: You can negotiate price reduction, accept as-is, or walk away if issues are serious.

### Negotiating After Inspection

**Strategies That Work:**
- Focus on safety and major systems
- Request repair or credit, not both
- Be reasonable with minor items
- Prioritize what matters most
- Get contractor estimates first

**What Sellers Usually Fix:**
- Safety hazards
- Major system failures
- Roof leaks
- Foundation issues
- Code violations

**What Sellers Usually Won't Fix:**
- Minor cosmetic items
- Normal wear and tear
- Disclosed issues
- Items clearly visible before offer

### Red Flags That Should Concern You

**Walk Away Considerations:**
- Major structural problems
- Extensive water damage or mold
- Electrical hazards throughout
- Foundation failure
- Repair costs exceed your budget

**Usually Negotiable:**
- HVAC needs replacement
- Roof has limited life left
- Plumbing updates needed
- Minor foundation cracks
- Electrical panel upgrade needed

### After the Inspection

**If Moving Forward:**
- Keep the inspection report
- Complete agreed-upon repairs
- Verify repairs were done correctly
- Plan for future maintenance
- Budget for items nearing end of life

**If Walking Away:**
- Review your contingency timeline
- Notify all parties in writing
- Ensure deposit is returned
- Learn from the experience
- Keep looking for the right home

### Budget for Post-Inspection

Set aside funds for:
- Immediate repairs not covered by seller
- First-year maintenance (1-2% of home value)
- System replacements in next 2-5 years
- Emergency repairs
- Routine maintenance and upkeep

### Common First-Time Buyer Mistakes

Even new homes need inspections. Never waive this contingency to make your offer more competitive.

**Mistake 2: Hiring the Cheapest Inspector**
Quality matters. This is your biggest purchase—invest in a thorough inspection.

You'll learn so much by being there. It's worth taking time off work.

**Mistake 4: Overreacting to Minor Issues**
Every house has problems. Focus on what really matters.

**Mistake 5: Not Reading the Full Report**
Don't just read the summary. Understanding details helps you plan for the future.
