### What to Expect During Your Home Inspection

If you're buying a home, a professional inspection is one of the most important steps in the process. Here's what you can expect when you schedule an inspection with Mizell Home Inspections.

### Before the Inspection

**Scheduling:** Most inspections can be scheduled within 24-48 hours and take 2-4 hours depending on the home's size and age.

**Your Attendance:** While not required, I strongly encourage buyers to attend. It's an excellent opportunity to learn about your future home and ask questions.

**Access:** Make sure utilities (water, electric, gas) are turned on so all systems can be tested.

### During the Inspection

I follow a comprehensive checklist covering all major home systems and components:

**Exterior Inspection**
- Roof condition and ventilation
- Siding, trim, and exterior finishes
- Windows and doors
- Grading and drainage
- Driveways, walkways, and patios
- Decks, porches, and railings

**Interior Inspection**
- Walls, ceilings, and floors
- Windows and doors
- Stairs and railings
- Electrical system and panels
- Plumbing system and fixtures
- HVAC system operation
- Attic insulation and ventilation
- Basement or crawl space

**Major Systems**
- Heating and cooling equipment
- Water heater
- Electrical panel and wiring
- Plumbing supply and drainage
- Foundation and structural components

### What I'm Looking For

During the inspection, I'm evaluating:
- **Safety Hazards:** Issues that could cause injury
- **Major Defects:** Problems requiring significant repair or replacement
- **System Functionality:** Whether components are working as intended
- **Maintenance Needs:** Items requiring attention or routine care

### After the Inspection

**The Report:** You'll receive a detailed inspection report within 24-48 hours, complete with:
- High-resolution photos
- Clear descriptions of findings
- Recommendations for repairs or further evaluation
- Easy-to-understand summary sections

**Follow-Up:** I'm available after the inspection to answer questions about the report or discuss findings with your real estate agent or contractors.

### Common Questions

**Can the seller be present?**
It's best if the seller is not present so buyers feel comfortable asking questions.

**What if problems are found?**
Most homes have some issues. The inspection helps you understand their severity and negotiate repairs or pricing accordingly.

**Do you test for mold or radon?**
These require specialized testing and can be added to your inspection package.

### Your Investment in Peace of Mind

A home inspection is an investment in your future. It provides the information you need to make a confident decision about one of life's biggest purchases.
