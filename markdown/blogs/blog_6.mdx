### How to Read Your Home Inspection Report

You've received your home inspection report and it's 50+ pages long with hundreds of items. Don't panic! Here's how to understand what you're reading and what really matters.

### Report Structure

Most professional inspection reports are organized by:
- **Summary Section:** Quick overview of major findings
- **System-by-System Breakdown:** Detailed findings for each area
- **Photos:** Visual documentation of issues
- **Recommendations:** Suggested actions and timeline

### Understanding Severity Levels

Reports typically categorize findings by severity:

**Safety Hazard**
- Immediate attention required
- Could cause injury
- Examples: Exposed wiring, gas leaks, structural instability
- **Action:** Address before closing or immediately after

**Major Defect**
- Significant repair or replacement needed
- Affects home functionality or value
- Examples: Failed HVAC, roof replacement needed, foundation issues
- **Action:** Negotiate repairs or price reduction

**Repair/Maintenance Item**
- Normal wear and tear
- Should be addressed but not urgent
- Examples: Minor leaks, worn caulking, filter replacement
- **Action:** Budget for near-term repairs

**Monitor/Informational**
- Items to watch or general observations
- Not currently problematic
- Examples: Minor cracks, older components still functioning
- **Action:** Plan for eventual replacement

### Common Report Items Explained

**"Recommend evaluation by licensed [specialist]"**
This means the inspector found something that requires specialized expertise. It's not necessarily bad—some issues need specialized testing or evaluation.

**"At/near end of service life"**
The component is old but still working. Budget for replacement soon, but it's not an emergency.

**"Further evaluation recommended"**
The inspector couldn't fully assess something due to access, weather, or other limitations. Follow up with additional inspection or testing.

**"Not to current code standards"**
The item was legal when installed but doesn't meet current codes. This is common in older homes and usually doesn't require updating unless you're renovating.

### What to Prioritize

**Fix Immediately (Safety Issues)**
1. Electrical hazards
2. Gas leaks
3. Structural instability
4. Fire safety issues
5. Water intrusion causing active damage

**Address Before Closing**
1. Major system failures (HVAC, water heater)
2. Roof leaks
3. Significant plumbing issues
4. Foundation problems
5. Pest infestations

**Plan for First Year**
1. Minor repairs and maintenance
2. System servicing
3. Weatherproofing
4. Cosmetic updates

**Long-Term Budget Items**
1. Components near end of service life
2. Future upgrades
3. Preventive maintenance

### Using Your Report for Negotiations

**Strong Negotiating Points:**
- Safety hazards
- Major system failures
- Roof or foundation issues
- Code violations
- Pest damage

**Weak Negotiating Points:**
- Minor cosmetic issues
- Normal wear and tear
- Items disclosed before offer
- Routine maintenance items

### Questions to Ask Your Inspector

After reading your report, follow up with questions:
- What are the top 3-5 priorities?
- What's the estimated cost range for major items?
- What issues could affect financing or insurance?
- Are there any safety concerns for moving in?
- What regular maintenance should I plan for?

### Don't Let Small Issues Derail Your Purchase

Remember, no home is perfect. Even new construction has inspection findings. Focus on:
- Safety and structural integrity
- Major system functionality
- Items that affect livability
- Problems that could worsen quickly

### The 10% Rule

Many inspectors use the 10% rule: if repair costs exceed 10% of the purchase price, consider renegotiating or walking away. Below that threshold, most issues are manageable.

### Keep Your Report

Your inspection report is valuable for:
- Future maintenance planning
- Insurance claims
- Contractor estimates
- Resale disclosure
- Home warranty reference

### Working With Contractors

When getting repair estimates:
- Show contractors the relevant report sections and photos
- Get multiple quotes for major work
- Verify licenses and insurance
- Ask for warranties on repairs

### The Bottom Line

A home inspection report is not meant to scare you—it's meant to inform you. Use it as a tool for negotiation, planning, and peace of mind. Most findings are normal and manageable.
