### Understanding Mold: When Should You Be Concerned?

Mold is one of the most misunderstood issues in home inspections. While some mold is common and harmless, other types can pose serious health risks and indicate underlying problems.

### What Causes Mold?

Mold needs three things to grow:
- **Moisture:** Leaks, humidity, or flooding
- **Organic Material:** Wood, drywall, carpet
- **Time:** Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours

### Warning Signs

You should be concerned about mold if you notice:
- Visible mold growth covering more than 10 square feet
- Persistent musty odors even after cleaning
- Water stains or discoloration on walls or ceilings
- Recent water damage or flooding

### When to Test for Mold

Professional mold testing is recommended when you can smell mold but cannot locate the source, or when family members experience unexplained health symptoms.
