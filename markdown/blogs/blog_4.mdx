### Florida Home Inspections: What Makes Them Unique?

Inspecting homes in Florida requires specialized knowledge of climate-specific issues. Here's what makes Florida home inspections different from other states.

### Hurricane and Wind Damage

Florida homes must withstand high winds and severe weather. Key inspection points include:
- **Roof Attachment:** Hurricane straps and clips
- **Impact-Resistant Windows:** Required in coastal areas
- **Garage Doors:** Wind-rated for hurricane protection
- **Roof Condition:** Missing shingles can become projectiles

### Moisture and Humidity Issues

Florida's humidity creates unique challenges:
- **Mold Growth:** High humidity promotes mold
- **Wood Rot:** Constant moisture affects wooden components
- **HVAC Sizing:** Systems must handle humidity removal
- **Ventilation:** Critical for preventing moisture buildup

### Termites and Wood-Destroying Organisms

Florida is ground zero for termite activity:
- **Subterranean Termites:** Most common in Florida
- **Drywood Termites:** Can infest any wooden structure
- **Regular Inspections:** Recommended annually
- **Treatment History:** Important to review documentation

### Foundation and Soil Concerns

Florida's unique soil composition affects foundations:
- **Sand and Limestone:** Can shift and settle
- **Sinkholes:** More common in central Florida
- **Concrete Slabs:** Most common foundation type
- **Cracking Patterns:** Can indicate settlement issues

### Saltwater and Coastal Corrosion

Homes near the coast face additional challenges:
- **Metal Corrosion:** HVAC, electrical panels, fasteners
- **Paint Deterioration:** Salt air accelerates breakdown
- **Concrete Spalling:** Salt exposure damages concrete
- **Screen Enclosures:** Corrosion of aluminum frames

### Electrical Considerations

Florida's wet climate affects electrical systems:
- **GFCI Requirements:** More extensive than other states
- **Outdoor Outlets:** Must be weather-resistant
- **Panel Corrosion:** Humidity affects electrical panels
- **Aluminum Wiring:** Common in older Florida homes

### Pool and Spa Inspections

Many Florida homes include pools:
- **Equipment Condition:** Pumps, filters, heaters
- **Safety Features:** Fences, alarms, covers
- **Structural Issues:** Cracks, leaks, tile condition
- **Electrical Safety:** Bonding and grounding

### Air Conditioning Systems

AC is essential in Florida:
- **System Sizing:** Must handle extreme heat and humidity
- **Age and Condition:** Systems work harder in Florida
- **Maintenance History:** Critical for longevity
- **Refrigerant Type:** Older systems may need upgrades

### Insurance Considerations

Florida home inspections often affect insurance:
- **Wind Mitigation:** Can reduce insurance premiums
- **4-Point Inspection:** Required for older homes
- **Roof Condition:** Directly affects insurability
- **Electrical Panel Type:** Some panels are uninsurable

### Why Choose a Florida-Experienced Inspector

These unique challenges require an inspector who understands Florida construction standards, building codes, and climate-specific issues. With years of experience inspecting Florida homes, I know exactly what to look for.
